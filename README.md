c# project with entity framework

School project where we had to create a  patient management app for a hospital. 

Front desk employee are able to add new patient, search existing patient and assigned them a room and a doctor. 
He can also choose tht type of room and amenities.

Doctors can search their patient list and send them home.

Both can add comment to the patient file.

Admins can add and remove employees.

Once discharged from the hospital, the app create a invoice for the patient calculating 
the number of days of his stay, the type of room and the amenities.
